This Resume Categorization_Screening&amp;Ranking* project uses AI, NLP, and Streamlit to automate resume sorting, screening, and ranking. It categorizes resumes based on job roles, filters for key qualifications, and ranks candidates according to job requirements, all through an interactive Streamlit interface.
